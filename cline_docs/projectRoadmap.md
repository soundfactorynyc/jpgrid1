# JPGrid1 - LED Control System Project Roadmap

## High-Level Project Goals

### Core System Development
- [x] Create UnifiedHarmonySystem component with grid interface
- [x] Integrate component into Astro project
- [x] Test and preview core functionality
- [ ] Implement WebSocket backend server
- [ ] Add hardware LED integration capabilities

### Key Features

#### Grid Interface System
- [x] 3-button main interface (top/middle/bottom)
- [x] 8x8 grid overlays (64 buttons each)
- [x] Different action types per grid:
  - Top Grid: LED Control (individual sections)
  - Middle Grid: Effects (rainbow, wave, pulse, etc.)
  - Bottom Grid: Presets (saved configurations)

#### LED Display System
- [x] 200x100 pixel LED display (20,000 total pixels)
- [x] Real-time pixel control
- [x] Color support (red, green, blue, yellow, purple, white, orange, pink, cyan)
- [x] Visual effects system
- [x] Section-based control

#### User Interface
- [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (1,2,3 for grids, Escape, Spacebar)
- [x] Status indicator with connection states
- [x] Smooth animations and transitions

### Completion Criteria
- [x] Component successfully integrated and previewing
- [x] All grid interactions working correctly
- [x] LED display responding to button presses
- [x] Visual effects functioning properly
- [x] WebSocket connection handling gracefully
- [x] Ready for backend server integration

## Completed Tasks
- [x] UnifiedHarmonySystem component architecture designed
- [x] Complete CSS styling with responsive design
- [x] JavaScript controller class implementation
- [x] LED pixel management system
- [x] Grid overlay system with animations

## Future Scalability Considerations
- WebSocket server for real-time LED control
- Hardware integration with actual LED strips/matrices
- Preset saving/loading system
- Multi-user control capabilities
- Performance optimization for large LED arrays
- Mobile app companion interface
